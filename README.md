# NimbusCode

A lightweight, portable AI coding assistant powered by OpenRouter's free models.

## Project Structure

This repository contains two implementations of NimbusCode:

- **[Python Implementation](./python/)**: A Python-based version that's easy to use and modify
- **[Rust Implementation](./rust/)**: A high-performance Rust version for maximum efficiency

## Features

- **Minimal Footprint**: Uses minimal disk space and memory
- **Portable**: Works across platforms with minimal dependencies
- **Code Generation**: Create code based on natural language descriptions
- **Code Improvement**: Get suggestions to improve existing code
- **Code Explanation**: Understand complex code with detailed explanations
- **Cloud Deployment**: Generate deployment instructions for AWS, Azure, and GCP
- **Mobile Development**: Get guidance for iOS, Android, and cross-platform development
- **Interactive Mode**: Have a conversation with the AI about your coding questions

## Choosing an Implementation

### Python Version

- Easier to install and modify
- Requires Python and minimal dependencies
- Great for quick usage and experimentation

### Rust Version
