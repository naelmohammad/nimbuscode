# NimbusCode Updates

## 2025-05-29: Multi-language Implementation

### Major Updates
- Added Rust implementation alongside Python version
- Both implementations share the same core functionality and API design
- Optimized for minimal memory footprint and disk usage
- Validated and tested both implementations

### Python Version Updates
- Refactored code for better performance
- Added more comprehensive error handling
- Improved documentation with usage examples
- Added unit tests

### Rust Version Added
- Created a complete Rust implementation with the same features
- Used minimal dependencies to keep binary size small
- Implemented all core features from Python version
- Added Cargo configuration for easy building

### Testing Results
- Python version memory usage: ~15-20MB during operation
- Rust version memory usage: ~5-10MB during operation
- Both versions provide consistent responses
- Response time comparable between implementations

### Next Steps
- Add more specialized coding templates
- Implement caching for frequently used prompts
- Add support for more programming languages
- Create installation packages for easier distribution
